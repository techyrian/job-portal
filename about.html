            <p style="font-size: 25px; width: 989px; margin-left: 22rem;">A whole new beginning of creativity levels!</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 10rem; margin-right: 5rem; font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">Starting at a very young age, at about 7 or 8, artist Rian Muppalla had start to make some drawings!
           Of course, they were never great, but that didn't let Rian stop from learning "What I have to do to make this drawing better?", so he kept using that saying, over and over again in his head, seeing what had to be
           finished, and at the same time he was also telling himself what had do be fixed. Eventualy, about 3 or 4 years later, Rian is now in middle school at 6th grade at the age of 11, he still continues to do art in his free time,
          and even though he got better at drawing (sort of..), he still uses the saying he first used when he was at the age around 7 or 8, "What I have to do to make this drawing better?", Rian still ends up making drawings, 
          and you can see most of them on this website! Where Rian likes to share his personalities and drawings!</p>
